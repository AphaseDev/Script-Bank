# **Benito Windows - Shortcut Keys**

* * *

win2posixPath and posix2winPath are usefull Batch scripts that can convert any Windows path to POSIX path (or vice versa) and copy the result into the clipboard and/or display it.
You can create shortcuts for these scripts and define dedicated shortcut keys.

Here is an example of shortcut key mapping I did on Windows 11:

Ctrl + Alt + 0 (num pad)			|	Launch Cmder terminal
Ctrl + Alt + 1 (num pad)			|	Launch win2posixPath conversion to Windows Clipboard
Ctrl + Alt + 2 (num pad)			|	Launch posix2winPath conversion to Windows Clipboard
Ctrl + Alt + 3 (num pad)			|	Launch win2posixPath conversion to Windows for Display
Ctrl + Alt + 4 (num pad)			|	Launch posix2winPath conversion to Windows for Display
